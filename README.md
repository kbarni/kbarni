Researcher in image processing at the IMS Bordeaux Laboratory, my main research topic is proximal sensing in agricultural applications.

This is the place for the open-source projects I build, mostly in my free time. These range from simple exercices to more complex libraries.

Some of the tools that I use:
- C++/Python for programming
- Qt/QML for graphical user interfaces and mobile development
- OpenCV library
- Deep neural networks
- GPU programming with CUDA
- Arduino and microcontrollers
- Embedded systems for conception of new cameras
